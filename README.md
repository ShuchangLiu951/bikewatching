This project creates an immersive, interactive map visualization of bike traffic across the Boston area. It integrates datasets from the Boston and Cambridge city governments as well as BlueBikes ride data (around 260,000 trips from March 2024) to show bike lane networks and station activity patterns. Users can explore traffic flow dynamically by zooming, panning, and filtering data by time of day with an intuitive slider interface.
